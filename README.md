# Software engineering I project
"Kinder" project about charity
made by Justas, Olegas, Rokas, Konstantinas

## IDEA
a chairity app inspired by Tinder's concept

"Takers" register what items are they short of
"Givers" register what items they have to donate

Users analise and swipe right if they see fit to communicate about donation, otherwise swipe left to see other items

each donation is worth some amount of Karma points, betermined by "Giver" (to evaluate items' worth). 
"givers" have leaderboards, to drive better engagement to participate in charity
