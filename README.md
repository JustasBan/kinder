# Software engineering I project
"Kinder" project about charity
made by Justas, Olegas, Rokas, Konstantinas

##Disclaimer!
to run our project, you shall first update database with latest migration (for example with "update-database" command")

## IDEA
a chairity app inspired by Tinder's concept

"Takers" register what items are they short of
"Givers" register what items they have to donate

Users analise and swipe right if they see fit to communicate about donation, otherwise swipe left to see other items

each donation is worth some amount of Karma points, betermined by "Giver" (to evaluate items' worth). 
"givers" have leaderboards, to drive better engagement to participate in charity

##old project
our project at first (for 1st and 2nd labaratory work) was based on WPF
